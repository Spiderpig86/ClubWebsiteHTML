# SBU Web and App Club Website

This is a website for the club to serve as our first project and showcase for our members and upcoming projects. The website is constructed with a combination of Spring (Java Back-end) and HTML, CSS, and Javascript (Front-end) with a responsive design.

## Website Features

1. Homepage with smoothscrolling and parallax (maybe?)
2. Members page showcasing personal projects, bio, and contact information.
3. Idea submission board for the public.
4. Maybe a club logo?
